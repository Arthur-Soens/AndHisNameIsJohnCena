# ## Hedging using Machine Learning Techniques

# ### Summary

# As systematic and macro factors dominate the investment landscape, we see equity investors move away from one-size-fits all hedging strategies to more precise ways to separate intended and unintended risks and isolate alpha. 
# 
# If you are a fundamental equity investor, take concentrated positions in single names, or have significant idiosyncratic risk that is otherwise difficult to hedge, this highly customizable correlation-based approach is for you. Traditional factor based hedges can fare poorly when most of the risk cannot be explained by factors â€“ in those instances this approach can allow for much better correlation to offset risk as well as a number of ways to guide which names get included while ensuring a high level of tradability by controlling liquidity and borrow costs.
# 
# In this notebook, we will showcase how to leverage this approach through one of our most popular tools, the [marquee performance hedger](https://marquee.gs.com/s/hedging/performance).
# 
# Additionally, based on feedback we have received from top users, we are adding the ability to easily run and compare hedges in python through [gs quant](https://developer.gs.com/docs/gsquant/) as well as new modeling techniques, two of whose key advantages are:
# 
# * **Increased accuracy** through reduced overfitting
# * **More control** by allowing the user to specify how concentrated or diversified the hedge portfolio is
# 
# 
# The contents of this notebook are as follows:
# * [1 - Let's get started with gs quant](#1---Let's-get-started-with-gs-quant)
# * [2 - Calculate a hedge](#2---Calculate-a-hedge)
# * [3 - Increased accuracy](#3---Increased-accuracy)
# * [4 - More control](#4---More-control)
# * [5 - Customizing your optimization](#5---Customizing-your-optimization)

# ### 1 - Let's get started with gs quant
# Start every session with authenticating with your unique client id and secret. If you don't have a registered app, create one [here](https://marquee.gs.com/s/developer/myapps/register). `run_analytics` scope is required for the functionality covered in this example.

# In[1]:


from gs_quant.session import GsSession, Environment
GsSession.use(client_id=None, client_secret=None, scopes=('run_analytics',))

# Below, you can set the logging level of the notebook. By default, we set the level to INFO to show informative statements about the hedging functions.

# In[2]:


import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

# ### 2 - Calculate a Hedge

# Let's start by calculating a hedge for Amazon with some starting parameters.
# 
# To leverage the (machine learning-based) techniques in the enhanced performance hedger, please ensure:
# * `use_machine_learning` parameter is true
# 
# Note: the hedge result utilizes optimal values found (using grid search) for the ML parameters, which are known as Concentration (`lasso_weight`) and Diversity (`ridge_weight`)

# ### 3 - Increased Accuracy

# Now let's compare results with and without using the new machine learning parameters and examine the first advantage - improved accuracy.
# 
# We can do this by looking at the out-of-sample differences in cumulative returns of the two hedges over a hedge backtest period. Note here that we fit the hedge to the observation window and use the backtest window to see how both hedges perform. 
# 
# Note for this example: the ML parameters, Concentration (lasso_weight) and Diversity (ridge_weight), are being manually passed in, which is an alternative way to run the new performance hedger (compared to running grid search to find the optimal pair)

# Now, we plot the cumulative returns of the target asset against the cumulative returns of each hedge.

# In[6]:


compare_backtests_against_target_asset(new_hedger_results, standard_results)

# As you can see above, the New Performance Hedger more closely tracks the target asset in the backtest, or "simulated future", period (and thus is more accurate).

# ### 4 - More Control

# Now, let's demonstrate the second advantage, namely the enhanced control we have over the performance hedger results.
# 
# Below, you can plot the effects of varying Concentration and Diversity on your hedge query from section 2 above. 
# 
# In this example, if the values for Concentration are 'None' and the values for Diversity are [10, 20], then the plotting function would run the hedge query passed in for Diversity values of 10% and 20% and then plot the weight/number of asset distributions on the y-axis and x-axis, respectively. 
# 

# In[7]:


# For now, use ONLY Concentration or Diversity when plotting to view the effects of this hyperparameter value changing on a hedge (set the hyperparam you aren't 
# using to None)
hyperparams = {'Concentration': None, 'Diversity': [10, 20]}

# In[8]:


from gs_quant.markets.hedge import Hedge

# Plot results of the hedge - with emphasis on the effects that either the Concentration or Diversity hyperparameter has on the hedge
hedge_plot = Hedge.plot_weights_against_number_of_assets(hedge_query_example, hyperparams, figsize=(10, 6))

# As you can see above, varying the value of a single hyperparameter has significant effects on the weights & total number of assets of the hedge portfolio that is constructed to hedge the single target asset.
# 
# For this particular example, the effect is that the weights become more balanced the more the "Diversity" hyperparameter increases.

# ### 5 - Customizing your Optimization

# Since we know how to run a basic hedge, let's experiment with the concentration and diversity metrics to find an optimal hedge.
# 
# Note, the hedger is flexible and allows you to choose which metric to optimize - for example, you may want to run to optimize correlation (in which case you would maximize r-squared) or to optimize transaction costs (in which case you would minimize total transaction costs).

# In[9]:


# Modify hyperparameter grid to the values you want to use to find the optimal hedge . As mentioned before, the terminology used for Concentration and Diversity
# seen below relates to the terminology used for each term in the machine learning literature.
# Concentration = Lasso (as a percentage)
# Diversity = Ridge (as a percentage)
hyperparams = {'Concentration': [0, 20, 40], 'Diversity': [10, 20]}

# Modify this to optimize a metric (maximize or minimize depending on the metric. 
# See the create_optimization_mappings function for how metrics are optimized
metric_to_optimize = 'rSquared'

# Let's now run the optimization through the custom grid of concentration/diversity values we specified, and optimize for the specified metric. In this case, we will look for the combination of concentration and diversity values that maximizes correlation, or r-squared.

# In[10]:


from gs_quant.markets.hedge import Hedge

opt_hedge, opt_metric_val, opt_hyperparams = Hedge.find_optimal_hedge(hedge_query_example, hyperparams, metric_to_optimize)
print(f'The optimal pair of hyperparameters was {opt_hyperparams}, achieving a value for {metric_to_optimize} '
                     f'of {opt_metric_val*100:.3}% during the out of sample period.')
