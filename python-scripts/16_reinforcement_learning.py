# # Setup

# First, let's make sure this notebook works well in both python 2 and 3, import a few common modules, ensure MatplotLib plots figures inline and prepare a function to save the figures:

# In[1]:


import numpy as np

    # %tensorflow_version only exists in Colab.
    get_ipython().run_line_magic('tensorflow_version', '1.x')

    get_ipython().system('pip install -q -U pyvirtualdisplay gym[atari,box2d]')
    IS_COLAB = True
except Exception:
    IS_COLAB = False

# Note: there may be minor differences between the output of this notebook and the examples shown in the book. You can safely ignore these differences. They are mainly due to the fact that most of the environments provided by OpenAI gym have some randomness.

# # Introduction to OpenAI gym

# In this notebook we will be using [OpenAI gym](https://gym.openai.com/), a great toolkit for developing and comparing Reinforcement Learning algorithms. It provides many environments for your learning *agents* to interact with. Let's start by importing `gym`:

# In[2]:


import gym


# Next we will load the MsPacman environment, version 0.

# In[3]:


env = gym.make('MsPacman-v0')


# Let's initialize the environment by calling is `reset()` method. This returns an observation:

# In[4]:


env.seed(42)
obs = env.reset()


# Observations vary depending on the environment. In this case it is an RGB image represented as a 3D NumPy array of shape [width, height, channels] (with 3 channels: Red, Green and Blue). In other environments it may return different objects, as we will see later.

# In[5]:


obs.shape


# An environment can be visualized by calling its `render()` method, and you can pick the rendering mode (the rendering options depend on the environment).

# **Warning**: some environments require access to your display, which opens up a separate window, even if you specify `mode="rgb_array"`. In general you can safely ignore that window. However, if Jupyter is running on a headless server (ie. without a screen) it will raise an exception. One way to avoid this is to install a fake X server like [Xvfb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xvfb). On Debian or Ubuntu:
# 
# ```bash
# $ apt update
# $ apt install -y xvfb
# ```
# 
# You can then start Jupyter using the `xvfb-run` command:
# 
# ```bash
# $ xvfb-run -s "-screen 0 1400x900x24" jupyter notebook
# ```
# 
# Alternatively, you can install the [pyvirtualdisplay](https://github.com/ponty/pyvirtualdisplay) Python library which wraps Xvfb:
# 
# ```bash
# python3 -m pip install -U pyvirtualdisplay
# ```
# 
# And run the following code:

# In[6]:


try:
    import pyvirtualdisplay
    display = pyvirtualdisplay.Display(visible=0, size=(1400, 900)).start()
except ImportError:
    pass


# In[7]:


env.render()


# In this example we will set `mode="rgb_array"` to get an image of the environment as a NumPy array:

# In[8]:


img = env.render(mode="rgb_array")
img.shape


# Let's plot this image:

# In[9]:


plt.figure(figsize=(5,4))
plt.imshow(img)
plt.axis("off")
save_fig("MsPacman")
plt.show()


# Welcome back to the 1980s! :)

# In this environment, the rendered image is simply equal to the observation (but in many environments this is not the case):

# In[10]:


(img == obs).all()


# Let's create a little helper function to plot an environment:

# In[11]:


def plot_environment(env, figsize=(5,4)):
    plt.figure(figsize=figsize)
    img = env.render(mode="rgb_array")
    plt.imshow(img)
    plt.axis("off")


# Let's see how to interact with an environment. Your agent will need to select an action from an "action space" (the set of possible actions). Let's see what this environment's action space looks like:

# In[12]:


env.action_space


# `Discrete(9)` means that the possible actions are integers 0 through 8, which represents the 9 possible positions of the joystick (0=center, 1=up, 2=right, 3=left, 4=down, 5=upper-right, 6=upper-left, 7=lower-right, 8=lower-left).

# Next we need to tell the environment which action to play, and it will compute the next step of the game. Let's go left for 110 steps, then lower left for 40 steps:

# In[13]:


env.seed(42)
env.reset()
for step in range(110):
    env.step(3) #left
for step in range(40):
    env.step(8) #lower-left


# Where are we now?

# In[14]:


plot_environment(env)
plt.show()


# The `step()` function actually returns several important objects:

# In[15]:


obs, reward, done, info = env.step(0)


# The observation tells the agent what the environment looks like, as discussed earlier. This is a 210x160 RGB image:

# In[16]:


obs.shape


# The environment also tells the agent how much reward it got during the last step:

# In[17]:


reward


# When the game is over, the environment returns `done=True`:

# In[18]:


done


# Finally, `info` is an environment-specific dictionary that can provide some extra information about the internal state of the environment. This is useful for debugging, but your agent should not use this information for learning (it would be cheating).

# In[19]:


info


# Let's play one full game (with 3 lives), by moving in random directions for 10 steps at a time, recording each frame:

# In[20]:


frames = []

n_max_steps = 1000
n_change_steps = 10

env.seed(42)
obs = env.reset()
for step in range(n_max_steps):
    img = env.render(mode="rgb_array")
    frames.append(img)
    if step % n_change_steps == 0:
        action = env.action_space.sample() # play randomly
    obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
    if done:
        break


# Now show the animation:

# In[21]:


def update_scene(num, frames, patch):
    patch.set_data(frames[num])
    return patch,

def plot_animation(frames, repeat=False, interval=40):
    fig = plt.figure()
    patch = plt.imshow(frames[0])
    plt.axis('off')
    anim = animation.FuncAnimation(
        fig, update_scene, fargs=(frames, patch),
        frames=len(frames), repeat=repeat, interval=interval)
    plt.close()
    return anim


# In[22]:


plot_animation(frames)


# Once you have finished playing with an environment, you should close it to free up resources:

# In[23]:


env.close()


# To code our first learning agent, we will be using a simpler environment: the Cart-Pole. 

# # A simple environment: the Cart-Pole

# The Cart-Pole is a very simple environment composed of a cart that can move left or right, and pole placed vertically on top of it. The agent must move the cart left or right to keep the pole upright.

# In[24]:


env = gym.make("CartPole-v0")


# In[25]:


env.seed(42)
obs = env.reset()


# In[26]:


obs


# The observation is a 1D NumPy array composed of 4 floats: they represent the cart's horizontal position, its velocity, the angle of the pole (0 = vertical), and the angular velocity. Let's render the environment...

# In[27]:


plot_environment(env)
plt.show()


# Now let's look at the action space:

# In[28]:


env.action_space


# Yep, just two possible actions: accelerate towards the left or towards the right. Let's push the cart left until the pole falls:

# In[29]:


env.seed(42)
obs = env.reset()
while True:
    obs, reward, done, info = env.step(0)
    if done:
        break


# In[30]:


plot_environment(env)
save_fig("cart_pole_plot")


# In[31]:


img.shape


# Notice that the game is over when the pole tilts too much, not when it actually falls. Now let's reset the environment and push the cart to right instead:

# In[32]:


obs = env.reset()
while True:
    obs, reward, done, info = env.step(1)
    if done:
        break


# In[33]:


plot_environment(env)
plt.show()


# Looks like it's doing what we're telling it to do. Now how can we make the poll remain upright? We will need to define a _policy_ for that. This is the strategy that the agent will use to select an action at each step. It can use all the past actions and observations to decide what to do.

# # A simple hard-coded policy

# Let's hard code a simple strategy: if the pole is tilting to the left, then push the cart to the left, and _vice versa_. Let's see if that works:

# In[34]:


frames = []

n_max_steps = 1000
n_change_steps = 10

env.seed(42)
obs = env.reset()
for step in range(n_max_steps):
    img = env.render(mode="rgb_array")
    frames.append(img)

    # hard-coded policy
    position, velocity, angle, angular_velocity = obs
    if angle < 0:
        action = 0
    else:
        action = 1

    obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
    if done:
        break


# In[35]:


plot_animation(frames)


# Nope, the system is unstable and after just a few wobbles, the pole ends up too tilted: game over. We will need to be smarter than that!

# # Neural Network Policies

# Let's create a neural network that will take observations as inputs, and output the action to take for each observation. To choose an action, the network will first estimate a probability for each action, then select an action randomly according to the estimated probabilities. In the case of the Cart-Pole environment, there are just two possible actions (left or right), so we only need one output neuron: it will output the probability `p` of the action 0 (left), and of course the probability of action 1 (right) will be `1 - p`.

# Note: instead of using the `fully_connected()` function from the `tensorflow.contrib.layers` module (as in the book), we now use the `dense()` function from the `tf.layers` module, which did not exist when this chapter was written. This is preferable because anything in contrib may change or be deleted without notice, while `tf.layers` is part of the official API. As you will see, the code is mostly the same.
# 
# The main differences relevant to this chapter are:
# * the `_fn` suffix was removed in all the parameters that had it (for example the `activation_fn` parameter was renamed to `activation`).
# * the `weights` parameter was renamed to `kernel`,
# * the default activation is `None` instead of `tf.nn.relu`

# In[36]:


import tensorflow as tf

# 1. Specify the network architecture
n_inputs = 4  # == env.observation_space.shape[0]
n_hidden = 4  # it's a simple task, we don't need more than this
n_outputs = 1 # only outputs the probability of accelerating left
initializer = tf.variance_scaling_initializer()

# 2. Build the neural network
X = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, n_inputs])
hidden = tf.layers.dense(X, n_hidden, activation=tf.nn.elu,
                         kernel_initializer=initializer)
outputs = tf.layers.dense(hidden, n_outputs, activation=tf.nn.sigmoid,
                          kernel_initializer=initializer)

# 3. Select a random action based on the estimated probabilities
p_left_and_right = tf.concat(axis=1, values=[outputs, 1 - outputs])
action = tf.multinomial(tf.log(p_left_and_right), num_samples=1)

init = tf.global_variables_initializer()


# In this particular environment, the past actions and observations can safely be ignored, since each observation contains the environment's full state. If there were some hidden state then you may need to consider past actions and observations in order to try to infer the hidden state of the environment. For example, if the environment only revealed the position of the cart but not its velocity, you would have to consider not only the current observation but also the previous observation in order to estimate the current velocity. Another example is if the observations are noisy: you may want to use the past few observations to estimate the most likely current state. Our problem is thus as simple as can be: the current observation is noise-free and contains the environment's full state.

# You may wonder why we are picking a random action based on the probability given by the policy network, rather than just picking the action with the highest probability. This approach lets the agent find the right balance between _exploring_ new actions and _exploiting_ the actions that are known to work well. Here's an analogy: suppose you go to a restaurant for the first time, and all the dishes look equally appealing so you randomly pick one. If it turns out to be good, you can increase the probability to order it next time, but you shouldn't increase that probability to 100%, or else you will never try out the other dishes, some of which may be even better than the one you tried.

# Let's randomly initialize this policy neural network and use it to play one game:

        action_val = action.eval(feed_dict={X: obs.reshape(1, n_inputs)})
        obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action_val[0][0])

# Now let's look at how well this randomly initialized policy network performed:

# In[38]:


plot_animation(frames)


# Yeah... pretty bad. The neural network will have to learn to do better. First let's see if it is capable of learning the basic policy we used earlier: go left if the pole is tilting left, and go right if it is tilting right. The following code defines the same neural network but we add the target probabilities `y`, and the training operations (`cross_entropy`,  `optimizer` and `training_op`):

# Looks like it learned the policy correctly. Now let's see if it can learn a better policy on its own.

# # Policy Gradients

# To train this neural network we will need to define the target probabilities `y`. If an action is good we should increase its probability, and conversely if it is bad we should reduce it. But how do we know whether an action is good or bad? The problem is that most actions have delayed effects, so when you win or lose points in a game, it is not clear which actions contributed to this result: was it just the last action? Or the last 10? Or just one action 50 steps earlier? This is called the _credit assignment problem_.
# 
# The _Policy Gradients_ algorithm tackles this problem by first playing multiple games, then making the actions in good games slightly more likely, while actions in bad games are made slightly less likely. First we play, then we go back and think about what we did.

# # Learning to Play MsPacman Using the DQN Algorithm

# **Warning**: Unfortunately, the first version of the book contained two important errors in this section.
# 
# 1. The actor DQN and critic DQN should have been named _online DQN_ and _target DQN_ respectively. Actor-critic algorithms are a distinct class of algorithms.
# 2. The online DQN is the one that learns and is copied to the target DQN at regular intervals. The target DQN's only role is to estimate the next state's Q-Values for each possible action. This is needed to compute the target Q-Values for training the online DQN, as shown in this equation:
# 
# $y(s,a) = \text{r} + \gamma . \underset{a'}{\max} \, Q_\text{target}(s', a')$
# 
# * $y(s,a)$ is the target Q-Value to train the online DQN for the state-action pair $(s, a)$.
# * $r$ is the reward actually collected after playing action $a$ in state $s$.
# * $\gamma$ is the discount rate.
# * $s'$ is the state actually reached after played action $a$ in state $s$.
# * $a'$ is one of the possible actions in state $s'$.
# * $Q_\text{target}(s', a')$ is the target DQN's estimate of the Q-Value of playing action $a'$ while in state $s'$.
# 
# I hope these errors did not affect you, and if they did, I sincerely apologize.

# ## Build DQN

# Note: instead of using `tf.contrib.layers.convolution2d()` or `tf.contrib.layers.conv2d()` (as in the first version of the book), we now use the `tf.layers.conv2d()`, which did not exist when this chapter was written. This is preferable because anything in contrib may change or be deleted without notice, while `tf.layers` is part of the official API. As you will see, the code is mostly the same, except that the parameter names have changed slightly:
# * the `num_outputs` parameter was renamed to `filters`,
# * the `stride` parameter was renamed to `strides`,
# * the `_fn` suffix was removed from parameter names that had it (e.g., `activation_fn` was renamed to `activation`),
# * the `weights_initializer` parameter was renamed to `kernel_initializer`,
# * the weights variable was renamed to `"kernel"` (instead of `"weights"`), and the biases variable was renamed from `"biases"` to `"bias"`,
# * and the default `activation` is now `None` instead of `tf.nn.relu`.

# Note: in the first version of the book, the loss function was simply the squared error between the target Q-Values (`y`) and the estimated Q-Values (`q_value`). However, because the experiences are very noisy, it is better to use a quadratic loss only for small errors (below 1.0) and a linear loss (twice the absolute error) for larger errors, which is what the code above computes. This way large errors don't push the model parameters around as much. Note that we also tweaked some hyperparameters (using a smaller learning rate, and using Nesterov Accelerated Gradients rather than Adam optimization, since adaptive gradient algorithms may sometimes be bad, according to this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08292)). We also tweaked a few other hyperparameters below (a larger replay memory, longer decay for the $\epsilon$-greedy policy, larger discount rate, less frequent copies of the online DQN to the target DQN, etc.).

# ## 9. Pong DQN

# In[95]:

env.action_space


# We see the observation space is a 210x160 RGB image. The action space is a `Discrete(6)` space with 6 different actions: actions 0 and 1 do nothing, actions 2 and 4 move the paddle up, and finally actions 3 and 5 move the paddle down. The paddle is free to move immediately but the ball does not appear until after 18 steps into the episode.
# 
# Let's play a game with a completely random policy and plot the resulting animation.

# In[97]:


# A helper function to run an episode of Pong. It's first argument should be a
# function which takes the observation of the environment and the current
# iteration and produces an action for the agent to take.

# The random policy does not fare very well. So let's try to use the DQN and see if we can do better.
# 
# First let's write a preprocessing function to scale down the input state. Since a single observation does not tell us about the ball's velocity, we will also need to combine multiple observations into a single state. Below is the preprocessing code for this environment. The preprocessing algorithm is two-fold:
# 
# 1. Convert the image in the observation to an image to only black and white and scale it down to 80x80 pixels.
# 
# 2. Combine 3 observations into a single state which depicts the velocity of the paddles and the ball.
